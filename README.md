# Become the absolute master of binaries 

Welcome to our cybersecurity workshop ! Hope you enjoyed the previous ones.

Today, we’re diving into a great tool to add to your reverse engineering toolkit : **GDB**.

## Some important links

* <https://github.com/longld/peda> - **GDB PEDA** (_Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB_)

* <https://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf> - **A GDB cheat sheet** (might be useful 😉)

## Step 1 - translate

The objective of this exercise is to read the `step1-translate` binary using GDB, and to guess the original C code that provided it.

Your goal is to recreate the same C code, then call an assistant !

_Tip : exploring the **disassemble** command might give you useful insights._


## Step 2 - PoC Arena

Let's deep dive into reverse engineering with the `step2-arena` binary ! This challenge is composed of three parts, each requiring you to input a different flag.

Your goal is to understand what the program does to find which flag it is waiting for.
